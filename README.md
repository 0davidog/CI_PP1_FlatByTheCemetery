Flat by the Cemetery is a portfolio website that showcases the visual work of an artist/illustrator.

The site is targeted at those that may wish to learn more about the work or follow any developments as well as potential clients and colaborators.

## Features

### Main Image
- The first thing a user will take notice of is the large background image that domminates the index page. This will immedietdly give the user an idea what the site is about and sets the tone stylisicly for the content within.
- A short line of description 'Art and illustration by David C. Oâ€™Gara. Based in Derbyshire, UK" is in front of the image in varying positions dependant of screen size. This wil let the user know the subject of the site if they weren't already aware. The container has a black background at half transparency to aid in readability and contrast against the page's background image.

As this is the only content that is featured exclusively on the landing/index page the user should have thier attention drawn to the header, displaying the sites title and its navigation menu.

### About the title and colour scheme

- The title for the site, 'Flat by the Cemetery' was chosen simply due to the fact the the sites author has lived for some years in an appartment building across from and old cemetery and had been using it already as an [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/flatbythecemetery/) handle where much the artwork is already shared.
- The colour scheme follows on from this theme in direct homage to a poster of the Luci Fulci film 'House by the Cemetery' that was displayed in the appartment after moving in. This color scheme is black (#000000) for the background, white (#ffffff) for the text and red (#ff0000) for highlights such as headings and active links. A grey colour (#888888) was chosen for emphasis of subtitles and the gallery's additional navingation menu.
- Originaly the red highlight used was a darker shade (#990000) out of personal preference but this was changed to aid in contrast and readability.

### About the font choice

The font choice for the site is the serif font Palatino as this resembles the text of a paperback novel and fits within the sites themes of horror-fiction. 
 
### Navigation Bar
  - The navigation bar sits below the sites h1 title in the header and displays in text the links for 'Home, Gallery, About and Contact'. Active and highlighted (hovered over) links will be displayed in red with the hovered-over links underlined while standard links are the sites default white with no extra adornment.
  - The order of the links reflect the visual nature of the site, users are encoraged to explore further after their encounter with the 'Home' page and presumably intend to check out more of the work directly at the 'Gallery'. Then if interested by the work the 'About' page offers a place they can visit next to learn a little more about the artist. Finally in the interest of further interaction the user can submit a message to the artist directly using the 'Contact' page.

### Footer

  - The footer sits at the bottom of every page in a fixed position and provides social media links for ease of access as this is often a users prefered mode of following work and communicating with indivdual creatives or small buisneses. The social links chosen were Instagram and YouTube and were illustrated using icons from font-awesome. These social links are aligned center. At the wireframe stage the social icons were intended to be fixed to the right but this prooved to be visually less appealing.
  - Underneath the social links is displayed a copyright reminder as users will be viewing images of an artists work. This is simply to discourage unorthorised use of the images. This is aligned center also for the same reasons as the social links.

### Gallery Section

  - Gallery section consists of a main menu page in which visitors can select from an option of 4 gallery collections, each their own page.
  - For extra ease of navigation users are given a second navigation bar under the initial nav-bar that provides text links to the main gallery page and the four collection pages.
  - The links are illustrated using specialy made thumbnail images that give a glimse of the artwork that will be inside each collection. Plain text giving the links a title  such as 'Collection 01' sits on top of the thumbnails.

  - Each collection page follows the same format as the main gallery page with links to four different image pages being illustrated by specialy made thumbnails images hinting at the works content and plain text giving the links a description of 'image 01' etc.

 - The final piece of the gallery section is the pages for each individual image, 16 in total.
 - I chose to do this as individual pagaes to give the user an opportunity to look closely at the work and in a decent size depending on the screen used.
 - The pages consist of the image/artwork, followed by the works title and a short line of description on the origin, idea or intended use of the artwork/design.

### About section
  - About section contains a paragraph which gives an overview of the artist and their work as well as links to Instagram, Youtube and Linkedin.
  - The section is also decorated with the same image use as the index background, used here as an aside to the text.

### Contact Form
  - The 'Contact' page contains a form in which the user can get in touch with the artist.
  - Form elements include text inputs for name, email and subject and a text field for message content.
  - A submit button, styled in red follows.
  - All fields except Subject will be required for submission.

  - Upon completing the form and hitting submit, the form (for the time being) will make use of CodeInstitutes form dump link given in the lessons leading up to the first project. This will open a link in a new window confirming the form was successful.
  - In the future the form should send the data given to the site's author via email message. 

![Screenshot 2023-07-16 at 14-03-46 Returned form data](https://github.com/0davidog/flatbythecemetery/assets/135815736/a2c16409-d6f7-4ce8-b3a4-a4aaa845b4b1)

## Future Features
- A blog page/section would be a great fit for a site that follows the work of an artist/creative allowing for periodic updates of activity in greater detail than offered in social media posts.
- A shop for selling prints of artwork or related goods would also be ideal.

### Flex Grid Tutorial

- Used a tutorial to create a flex-grid that allows content to be arranged in a grid in a responsive manner.
- [link to tutorial](https://www.taniarascia.com/easiest-flex-grid-ever/)
- My css code:
  
```
  /* setting a flex grid for about section */
/* learning from https://www.taniarascia.com/easiest-flex-grid-ever/ */
#about-section {
	margin-top: 100px;
	margin-bottom: 100px;
	display: flex;
	flex-direction: row;
	flex-wrap: wrap;
}
#portrait {
	text-align: center;
	flex-basis: 100%;
	padding-top: 50px;
	color: #888888;
}
#portrait img {
	width: 80%;
	padding-bottom: 10px;
}
#about-text {
	line-height: 200%;
	padding: 50px;
	flex-basis: 100%;
}
 ```

 ```
/*media query for flex grid */
/* learning from https://www.taniarascia.com/easiest-flex-grid-ever/ */	
@media screen and (min-width: 1500px) {
	#portrait {
    flex: 3.5;
