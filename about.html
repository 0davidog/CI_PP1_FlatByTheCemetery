					<h2>David C. O'Gara</h2>
					<p><em>A flat by a cemetery, Derby, UK</em></p>
					<p>Strange creatures, dark rooms and vivid nightmares. These are the themes in much of the work contained within this portfolio. Inspired by horror cinema, comics and heavy metal. Thanks for checking out this website/portfolio. This is a place in which I can show you something that's been a hobby of mine for many years; art, comic illustration and animation.</p>
